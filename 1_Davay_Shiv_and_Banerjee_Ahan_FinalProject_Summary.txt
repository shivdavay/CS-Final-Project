Ahan and Shiv developed a game known as Freestyle Carrom. In
this game, there are numerous features such as in-game music, 
leaderboard, and file I/O for saving the scores for each person
after the game ends. Within the game, the players can launch the 
striker to hit the discs to try to get them in the pockets to get
points. We learned about incorporating various techniques with audio, 
file I/O, and panel swapping. With the various features that we added, 
we were able to achieve all of the requirements up to the accelerated 
mark; therefore, we believe that we should receive 100/100 points on 
this project because of the complexity, intricate planning, and user 
interactivity of the game.
